<a name="mission"></a>
## Club mission
The DC Tech & Robotics Club is for students interested in robotics or engineering. Our main focus is in robotics but we also investigate other areas of technology and engineering. We do a variety of projects and also compete in the Square One Innovative Vehicle Design Competition. Meet most Mondays and Fridays till around 4:00pm.

<a name="car"></a>
## The car

There are two major parts to how the car works. First there is the Hardware i.e. all the motors, servos, sensors, and microprocessors. Basically anything on the car is considered hardware. Then there is the software i.e. all of the code that controls the car.

<!-- GETTING STARTED split into with github with the hardware with programming -->
<a name="start"></a>
## Getting started with Git

To be able to contribute to this repository you will need to install git on your system I recommend following [GitHub's guide on Installing Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).

<a name="using_git"></a>
### Using Git 

To learn how to use git I recommend watching and reading about [The Missing Semester's](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/) lecture on git but if you don't have the patience or time you can read [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/) and learn the basics.

Once you have installed Git and learned the basics you are now able to [Contribute](#contributing).

###### If you need help with any part of this feel free to ask another member of the club.
